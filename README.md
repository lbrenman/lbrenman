# Leor Brenman's Profile

I've worked as an Application Engineer and Field Application Engineer in the Semicondictor space after Electrical Engineering graduate school working for comapnies like [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com), [Conexant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conexant) and SmartLink focusing on digital signal processing programming in assembler and C.

More recently, I've worked as a pre-sales engineer and solution architect in the Enterprise Software space working for comapnies like Vaultus (acquired by Antenna which was acquired by [Pega Systems](https://www.pega.com/) and Appcelerator (acquired by [Axway](https://www.axway.com/en)) focusing on cross device mobile app development, mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), API development and Integrations.
