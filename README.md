# Leor Brenman's Profile

After graduating with a Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering from [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/), I worked as an Application Engineer and Field Application Engineer in the Semiconductor space. I worked for [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com), [Conexant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conexant) and startups Sierra Semiconductor and SmartLink focusing on digital signal processing (DSP) hardware and programming in assembler and C, modems, voice over IP (VOIP), pre-sales support, technical training and technical publishing. In these roles, I sold to and supported companies such as: Sun Microsystems, Hewlett Packard, Motorola, Canon, Samsung, US-Robotics, Zoom Telephonics and many plugin card and laptop manufacturers in APAC.

Since 2007, I've worked as a Sales Engineer and Solution Architect in the Enterprise Software space working for Vaultus (acquired by Antenna which was acquired by [Pega Systems](https://www.pega.com/)) and Appcelerator (acquired by [Axway](https://www.axway.com/en)). I've focused on cross device mobile app development, mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), API development and Integrations (iPaaS). In these roles I helped close deals by fielding technical issues, creating and presenting compelling pre-sales and event demos, creating and delivering enablement material, such as blog posts, videos and training material as well as being the SME on several product areas including implementing PSO projects.  In these roles, I sold to, and supported companies such as: ING Bank, Schwab, Brown Brothers Harriman, Merril Lynch, Boehringer Ingelheim, Centene, Cargobase, Highmark, Regions Bank, ICW Group, Gesa Credit Union, LAM Research and Sopheon.
