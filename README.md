# Leor Brenman's Profile

After graduating with a Master's in Electrical Engineering from [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/), I worked as an Application Engineer and Field Application Engineer in the Semiconductor space. I worked for [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com), [Conexant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conexant) and startups Sierra Semiconductor and SmartLink focusing on digital signal processing (DSP) hardware and programming in assembler and C, modems, voice over IP (VOIP), pre-sales support, technical training and technical publishing.

Since 2007, I've worked as a Sales Engineer and Solution Architect in the Enterprise Software space working for Vaultus (acquired by Antenna which was acquired by [Pega Systems](https://www.pega.com/)) and Appcelerator (acquired by [Axway](https://www.axway.com/en)). I've focused on cross device mobile app development, mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), API development and Integrations. In these roles I helped close deals by fielding technical issues, creating and presenting compelling pre-sales and event demos, creating enablement material, such as blog posts and training collateral as well as being the SME on several product areas.
